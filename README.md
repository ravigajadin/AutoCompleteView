AutoCompleteView for Xamarin Forms.

Thanks Dottor Pagliaccius!

Original Code: https://github.com/DottorPagliaccius/Xamarin-Custom-Controls

Made following changes:
- Merged AutoCompleteView and ReepeaterView both into one file
- Add property SearchTextChangedCommand
- Add property SelectedItemCommand
- Add property SearchEntryFocus
- Changed behaviour after Item is selected by cleaning Entry and executing other commands
